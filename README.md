## Elevator Pitch

With just a tap of a button, discover a world of layers. **

## REACT pt1
- [x] **Bundled and transpiled** - done!
- [x] **Components** - Login, quote generator, favorite quotes of friends.
  - [x] **login** - When you press enter or the login button it takes you to the quote generator page
  - [x] **database** - Displayed the favorites of other users. Currently using local storage.
  - [x] **WebSocket** - real time communication between users and quotes. There will be a function of printing the favorites of other users
  - [x] **application logic** - The highlight and list users change based up the user's selections of favorite quotes.
- [x] **Router** - Routing between login and quote components.
- [x] **Hooks** - used onClick button for the quote but not fully functional yet

## React Phase 2: Reactivity deliverable

For this deliverable I used JavaScript and React so that the application completely works for a single user. I also added placeholders for future technology.

- [x] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** - Everything is working! Votes stored in local storage. `setInterval` used to simulate grab favorites quotes and previously liked quotes.
- [x] **Hooks** - Used `useState` and `useEffect` on the quotes view
- [x] setInterval to print out the quotes people have liked in live time
- [x] useState used for log in !
- [x] useEffect practiced on the about component to make a typewriter effect but also in the play component to generate the random quotes!
- [x] login finished!!   


## Service deliverable

For this deliverable I added backend endpoints that receives votes and returns the voting totals.

- [x] **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - done!
- [x] **Static middleware for frontend** - done!
- [x] **Calls to third party endpoints** - done! (quotes forismatic)
- [x] **Backend service endpoints** - Placeholders for login that stores the current user on the server. Endpoints for log in and quotes and saving quotes
- [x] **Frontend calls service endpoints** - I did this using the fetch functions (fetching the quotes, users that liked the quotes)
- [x] **Supports registration, login, logout, and restricted endpoint** - Login only exists on the frontend. 


## DB/Login deliverable

For this deliverable I associate the votes with the logged in user. I stored the votes in the database.

- [x] **Stores data in MongoDB** - done!
- [x] **Use MongoDB to store credentials** - Stores both user and their quotes -> took alot of time because I tried to take into account duplicates and lists of users that liked quotes and most liked quotes
